<h1>Blind-Assistant</h1>
<p>
Blind-Assistant is an android application that serves as an automated gesture-based application that is totally under the control of the blind for performing daily chores and reducing the intervention of the third party.
Additionally, the application uses a text-to-speech engine to read out a text smartly and concisely. A speech-to-text engine is also used to receive and confirm necessary input from the blind.
